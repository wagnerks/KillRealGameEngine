there is just some piece of pet project, you can find a lot of draft and junk code here, but i will fix every module after finishing working on it

The main goal is to create and to try modern fast game engine included draw and physics parts, with dod ecs, with high quality light system. Thinking about doing it specifically for some piece of open world space survival game.   

Which means really big open world, atmospheres, stars, lights, may be some procedural algorithm for planets and star systems, and I want it looks as much as possible.

# GOALS  

- [x] Entity Component System with Data Oriented Design
- [x] OpenGL Scene Rendering  
- [x] 3d models loading
- [x] imgui
- [x] deferred shading
- [x] directional ortho light shadows
- [ ] perspective ortho light
- [ ] point light
- [ ] sky (don't like current realisation) 
- [ ] invent engine name (KillReallGameEngine not bad, but is the best?)
- [x] frustum culling
- [ ] depth culling
- [x] LOD
- [ ] LOD depending on screen space size instead distane
- [ ] batcher (existing just draft)
- [ ] own 3d math module
- [ ] custom allocator for game data (models, sprites etc)
- [x] custom allocator for ECS
- [ ] entities actions
- [ ] physics engine (want my own)
- [x] ability to draw object via custom shader which ok with deferred shading
- [ ] precompile models format and faster models loading in game
- [ ] own gui (imgui good, but not very fast)
- [ ] add specular and other maps to the models
- [ ] skeleton animation
- [ ] (possible some 3d tools for converting normals in needed for me way)
- [x] added converting normals to engine coordinates system
- [ ] 3d objects visual redactor utils
- [ ] drag and drop
- [ ] choose object by click
- [x] outlines
- [x] multithread integration, first of all add ability to update systems in parallel(almost done but no pushed yet)
- [x] Shadows (don't like how it looks now, but it works) 
- [ ] SSAO(current algorithm is not fast enough, and have some glitches while fast moving)
- [ ] SSR
- [x] HDR
- [ ] volumetric FOG
- [x] logs
- [ ] logs to file
- [ ] volumetric clouds with shadows
- [ ] dynamic meshes
- [ ] vulkan 
- [ ] directx
- [ ] ray tracing
- [ ] grass  

I will add new goals as soon as find somenew
